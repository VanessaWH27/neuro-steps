**Dementia**
A general term for loss of memory, language, problem-solving, and other thinking abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia is not a specific disease but rather a syndrome caused by various diseases and conditions. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. In modern medical terminology, dementia is also referred to as Major Neurocognitive Disorder (MND) in the DSM-5.

**Parkinson's Disease (PD)**
A progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs when nerve cells (neurons) in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, weaken, become damaged, and die. These neurons normally produce dopamine, a brain chemical essential for controlling movement. Symptoms include tremor, muscle stiffness, slowed movement (bradykinesia), and impaired balance and coordination. PD also causes non-motor symptoms such as cognitive changes, depression, sleep problems, and autonomic dysfunction.
