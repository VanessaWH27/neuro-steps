# Structure

The human brain is the body's control center, responsible for everything from basic life functions to complex thoughts and emotions. Understanding its structure is essential for studying neurological conditions like Alzheimer's Disease.

## Major Brain Regions

The brain consists of four major regions:

### Cerebrum
- **Largest structure** of the brain
- Gives us conscious control of our actions
- Divided into two hemispheres: left and right
- Responsible for higher-level processes including language, memory, reasoning, thought, learning, decision-making, emotion, intelligence, and personality

### Diencephalon
- Mediates sensations and manages emotions
- Commands whole internal systems
- The **thalamus** forms most of the diencephalon and acts as a relay station for sensory information

### Cerebellum
- Adjusts body movements and speech coordination
- Maintains balance, posture, and coordination
- Controls fine motor skills

### Brainstem
- Relays signals from the spinal cord
- Directs basic internal functions and reflexes
- Consists of three structures: **midbrain**, **pons**, and **medulla oblongata**

## The Cerebral Cortex and Lobes

The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum and is divided into four lobes, each with specialized functions:

### Frontal Lobe
- **Largest lobe** of the brain
- **Executive functions**: emotional regulation, planning, reasoning, and problem-solving
- **Motor functions**: coordination and planning of movements
- Contains **Broca's area** for speech production
- Involved in personality characteristics and decision-making
- Recognition of smell

### Parietal Lobe
- Processes **sensory information**: touch, pressure, pain, temperature, vibration
- Handles spatial processing and manipulation
- Contains the **somatosensory cortex** which receives sensory input from the entire body
- Involved in speech, reading, and proprioception (body position awareness)

### Temporal Lobe
- **Language comprehension** and speech formation
- **Auditory processing**: contains the primary auditory cortex
- Contains the **hippocampus**, critical for memory, learning, and emotions
- Processes sound-to-visual image conversion
- Involved in nonverbal interpretation

### Occipital Lobe
- **Smallest lobe** in the cerebral cortex
- Primary role in **visual processing** and interpretation
- Handles distance and depth perception, color determination
- Responsible for object and face recognition
- Contains the **primary visual cortex**
