# Statistics for AD Research

## Why statistics matters
We compare groups and predict outcomes.

## Mean and variance
Definitions and intuition.

### Mean
$$ \mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i $$

### Variance
$$ \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum (x_i - \mu)^2 $$

## Classification metrics
Used in AD diagnosis models.

### Sensitivity
### Specificity
